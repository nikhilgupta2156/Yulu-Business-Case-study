<h2>🚲 YULU BUSINESS CASE STUDY | HYPOTHESIS TESTING USING PYTHON</h2>

<p>
  I had the opportunity to work on a real-world business case study for <strong>Yulu</strong>, a shared electric cycle service provider in India. The objective was to apply <strong>hypothesis testing techniques</strong> using Python to understand what factors influence the rental demand of electric cycles.
</p>

<h3>🎯 Objective:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To analyze the impact of time, weather, and day-type factors on electric cycle rentals</li>
  <li>To guide data-driven decisions for demand forecasting and operational planning</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔍 What I Did:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Performed data cleaning and extracted time-based features (hour, day, month, season, etc.)</li>
  <li>Visualized rental trends using line plots, boxplots, and histograms</li>
  <li>Conducted <strong>2-sample independent t-tests</strong> to test rental differences between weekdays and weekends</li>
  <li>Applied <strong>one-way ANOVA</strong> to analyze rental variation across different weather types and seasons</li>
  <li>Used <strong>Chi-square tests</strong> to evaluate dependency between categorical variables like season and weather</li>
  <li>Ensured assumptions of normality and equal variance through Q-Q plots, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and Levene's test</li>
</ul>

<h3>📈 Key Learning:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learned how to apply formal <strong>hypothesis testing framework</strong> in a real business context</li>
  <li>Discovered which factors significantly impact rentals (season and weather), and which do not (weekend vs. weekday)</li>
  <li>Understood how statistical testing can support business decisions in <strong>inventory planning and operations</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠 Tools & Skills Used:</h3>
<p>
  Python | Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Hypothesis Testing | ANOVA | Chi-square Test | EDA | Data Visualization | Business Insight | Scipy Stats
</p>

<h4>💡 Business Takeaway:</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Yulu</strong> can use the findings to <strong>allocate electric cycles seasonally</strong>, adjust operations based on weather forecasts, and understand user behavior patterns across time. Hypothesis testing helped uncover <strong>which variables truly matter</strong> in predicting cycle demand—an essential step toward scaling smart urban mobility.
